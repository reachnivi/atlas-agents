"""
experience_distiller.py — Turn an expensive victory into a permanent asset.

Experience distillation from §20.3: when the agent finally cracks a gnarly
task on attempt nine, a static system throws the session away — the token
spend bought one pull request. This script compresses the winning trajectory
into a compact worked example, stores it in Chroma, and demonstrates the
payoff: the same task class converging in one attempt instead of nine.

Flow:
  1. Load a trajectory log (JSONL of attempts, or the built-in demo one)
  2. Distill it: task, key decisions, verified outcome — no session data
  3. Embed and store the example in a Chroma collection
  4. Simulate a new, similar task: retrieve the example, inject it into
     context, and show the first attempt starting where attempt 9 left off

Usage:
    python experience_distiller.py [--trajectory session.jsonl]
