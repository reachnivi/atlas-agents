"""
adversarial_pair.py — A builder/adversary harness from §21.2.

One agent produces, a second attacks, and only their disagreements are
surfaced to the human. The practical advice from the chapter: review the
disagreements, not the output. When builder and adversary agree, the work
is almost always fine; when they disagree, that disagreement is the most
information-dense artifact the system produces.

The adversary is not a politeness layer. Its prompt gives no credit for
agreeing: its only job is to find the input that breaks the artifact, the
requirement it silently dropped, the assumption that was wrong on day one.

Includes the stats tracker that tells you when your adversary has become a
rubber stamp — if it has never once blocked a builder, you don't have an
adversary, you have a second bill.

Usage:
    python adversarial_pair.py "Write a Python function that parses ISO-8601 durations"

Requires: pip install anthropic
