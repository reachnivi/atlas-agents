Handoff with Context Compression (Online Extra)
==================================================
When handing off between agents, the raw conversation history
can blow up the context window. This module compresses the
history into a concise summary before injecting it into the
target agent's system prompt.

Usage:
    python handoff_with_context.py

Requires: pip install openai
